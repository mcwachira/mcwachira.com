Fundi Kipusa is a Kenyan community-based organization website I built to showcase their mission of empowering young Kenyans with vital skills.

Website Purpose:

Community Focus: The website emphasizes Fundi Kipusa's commitment to youth development and building a better future for Kenya.
Volunteer Opportunities: Attract potential volunteers who share Fundi Kipusa's vision by showcasing their impact and the opportunity to contribute.
Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Front-End Development: This project highlights my proficiency in building websites using fundamental web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
Informative Content Creation: The website effectively communicates Fundi Kipusa's mission, programs, and impact through well-structured and engaging content.
Community Focus: The design and content aim to build a sense of community and inspire user engagement.
This website demonstrates my ability to:

Translate a non-profit organization's mission into a user-friendly website.
