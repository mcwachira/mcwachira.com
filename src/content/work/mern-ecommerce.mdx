MERN Ecommerce App is a full-stack e-commerce website I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This application allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete secure purchases.

Key Features:

Product Catalog: Explore a diverse range of products with detailed descriptions, images, and variations (if applicable).
User Accounts: Create accounts to manage profiles, track order history, and personalize the shopping experience.
Shopping Cart: Add and remove items from the cart with ease, view running totals, and proceed to checkout securely.
Secure Checkout: Implement a secure payment gateway to ensure safe and reliable transactions.
Technical Stack:

MERN Stack: Utilize the full power of the MERN stack for robust functionality on both the front-end (React.js) and back-end (Node.js and Express.js), with data persistence handled by MongoDB.
E-commerce Functionality: Integrate features essential for a seamless online shopping experience, including product management, user authentication, shopping cart management, and secure payment processing.
This project demonstrates my expertise in:

Full-Stack Development: Effectively combining front-end and back-end technologies to create a comprehensive e-commerce application.
MERN Stack Proficiency: Building a robust and scalable e-commerce platform using the MERN stack.
E-commerce Functionality: Implement core features for a user-friendly and secure online shopping experience
